Project: AutoLogger
Purpose: I wanted to play around with the browser automation in vba and thought it would be fun to 
	make a program that could navigate and login to a website automatically

Future plans: Save and encrypt site information so that it doesn't have to be entered every time
		Allow for multiple simultaneous logins
		Add checks to ensure the navigation and login process do not cause the program to crash if they are invalid
